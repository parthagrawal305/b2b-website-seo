# 🏭 SEO Website Redesign Experiment

Took a real industrial manufacturer's live website — just the URL, nothing else — and tried to build a fully SEO-optimized redesign entirely through AI conversations.

The question was simple: *can you go from "here's a URL" to "this ranks #1" using only vibe coding?*

## What happened

Started by pasting the existing site URL into Google AI Studio and asking for a full SEO audit. Got back a competitive gap analysis, missing keywords, and a content strategy — all from one prompt.

Then used Cursor to scaffold a Next.js site informed by that strategy. The AI had full context from 12+ strategy documents (keyword research, schema markup plans, featured snippet targeting, blog editorial calendar), so every page it generated was already optimized.

The project ended up with more planning docs than code — which is kind of the point. SEO is a content problem, not an engineering problem, and AI is really good at content problems.

## The strategy docs

All generated through AI conversations:

- **SEO Keyword Strategy** — 50+ keywords mapped to pages
- **Blog Content Strategy** — 12-month editorial calendar
- **Featured Snippets Plan** — targeting paragraph, list, and table snippets
- **Schema/Structured Data** — JSON-LD for Product, Organization, FAQ, Breadcrumb
- **Competitive Analysis** — gap analysis vs top 3 competitors
- **Conversion Strategy** — trust signals, video content, CTA optimization
- **Site Architecture** — URL hierarchy and internal linking plan

> **Note:** This is an independent experiment. I'm not affiliated with the business whose site I redesigned. Just wanted to see how far AI-driven SEO could go.
