# How to Conduct a Pressure Test on Industrial Valves

In industries like oil, gas, power, water treatment, and chemical processing, the integrity of every component plays a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient operations. Pressure testing is a fundamental quality assurance procedure that verifies valve integrity before installation.

## Why Pressure Testing is Important

- **Safety Assurance** - Confirms the valve can withstand operating pressures
- **Leak Detection** - Identifies any manufacturing defects
- **Quality Verification** - Ensures compliance with specifications
- **Documentation** - Provides records for regulatory compliance

## Types of Pressure Tests

### 1. Shell Test (Body Test)

Tests the pressure-containing capability of the valve body.

- Valve is in partially open position
- Pressure applied to verify body integrity
- No leakage allowed through body or joints

### 2. Seat Test (Closure Test)

Tests the sealing capability of the valve seats.

- Valve is in fully closed position
- Pressure applied from one side
- Leakage rate measured and compared to standards

### 3. Backseat Test

Tests the stem seal when backseated (for gate and globe valves).

- Valve fully open in backseat position
- Packing gland loosened
- No leakage allowed through stem

## Testing Standards

| Standard | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| API 598 | Valve Inspection and Testing |
| API 6D | Pipeline Valves |
| BS EN 12266 | Testing of Metallic Valves |
| ISO 5208 | Pressure Testing of Metallic Valves |
| ASME B16.34 | Valves - Flanged, Threaded, and Welding End |

## Test Pressures

### Shell Test Pressure
Typically 1.5 times the rated pressure at 38°C (100°F)

### Seat Test Pressure
- **Low Pressure**: 0.4-0.7 bar (air or nitrogen)
- **High Pressure**: 1.1 times rated pressure (water)

## Step-by-Step Testing Procedure

### Step 1: Preparation

- Clean the valve internally and externally
- Install test blinds or caps on ends
- Connect to test bench
- Ensure safety measures are in place

### Step 2: Shell Test

1. Position valve in partially open (15° to 30°)
2. Fill valve with test medium (usually water)
3. Remove all air from the system
4. Apply pressure gradually to test level
5. Hold for required duration (typically 2-5 minutes)
6. Inspect for leakage on body, bonnet, and joints
7. Record results

### Step 3: Low Pressure Seat Test (Air)

1. Close the valve completely
2. Apply air or nitrogen at low pressure
3. Check for bubble formation using soapy water
4. Record any leakage

### Step 4: High Pressure Seat Test (Hydrostatic)

1. Keep valve closed
2. Apply water pressure from one side
3. Hold for required duration
4. Measure any leakage through seats
5. Compare with allowable limits
6. Repeat from opposite side if required

### Step 5: Documentation

- Record all test parameters
- Note valve details (size, class, serial number)
- Document any observations
- Sign off by quality inspector

## Acceptable Leakage Rates

Per API 598:

| Valve Type | Leakage Rate |
|------------|--------------|
| Gate Valves | Zero (metal seated) |
| Globe Valves | Zero |
| Ball Valves | Zero (soft seated) |
| Check Valves | As per specification |
| Butterfly Valves | Rate A, B, C, or D per standard |

## Safety Precautions

1. **Personal Protective Equipment** - Safety glasses, gloves, hearing protection
2. **Pressure Relief** - Ensure system has relief valve
3. **Secure Mounting** - Valve must be properly secured
4. **Clear Area** - No personnel in line of fire
5. **Trained Personnel** - Only qualified operators
6. **Inspection of Equipment** - Verify test equipment condition

## Test Equipment

- Hydrostatic test pump
- Pressure gauges (calibrated)
- Test blinds/caps
- Timer
- Recording instruments
- Safety relief valve

## Quality Documentation

At Unison Valves, every valve undergoes:

- 100% hydrostatic shell and seat testing
- Test certificate with complete parameters
- Material certificates (MTR)
- Dimensional inspection report
- Visual and radiographic examination (as required)
