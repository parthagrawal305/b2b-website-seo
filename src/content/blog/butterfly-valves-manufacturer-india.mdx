# Butterfly Valves Manufacturer and Supplier in India

Unison Valves is a trusted name among **butterfly valve manufacturers in India**, delivering reliable and high-performance solutions for a wide range of industrial applications.

## What is a Butterfly Valve?

A butterfly valve is a quarter-turn rotational motion valve used to control flow. It uses a disc mounted on a rotating shaft, which when rotated 90°, either allows or blocks the flow of fluid.

### Key Advantages

- **Compact Design** - Takes up less space than gate or ball valves
- **Light Weight** - Easier to handle and install
- **Quick Operation** - 90° rotation for full open/close
- **Cost-Effective** - Lower cost for large diameter applications
- **Low Pressure Drop** - Efficient flow characteristics

## Types of Butterfly Valves

### 1. Concentric (Resilient Seat)

- Disc center is same as stem center
- Suitable for low to medium pressure applications
- Common in water, air, and general services
- Most economical option

### 2. Double Offset (High Performance)

- Disc center is offset from stem center
- Reduced wear on seat
- Better sealing performance
- Suitable for higher pressures

### 3. Triple Offset (Metal Seated)

- Most advanced design
- Zero friction during operation
- Suitable for high temperature and pressure
- Excellent for isolation service
