# Comparing Gate, Globe, Ball Valves, and Butterfly Valves

When it comes to optimizing your operations, choosing the right valve can significantly impact flow efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Each valve type has unique characteristics that make it suitable for specific applications.

## Quick Comparison Table

| Feature | Gate Valve | Globe Valve | Ball Valve | Butterfly Valve |
|---------|------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Primary Function** | On/Off | Throttling | On/Off | On/Off |
| **Pressure Drop** | Low | High | Very Low | Low |
| **Flow Control** | Poor | Excellent | Limited | Good |
| **Actuation Speed** | Slow | Slow | Fast | Fast |
| **Maintenance** | Moderate | Moderate | Low | Low |
| **Cost** | Moderate | High | Moderate | Low |

## Gate Valves

### How They Work
Gate valves use a sliding gate mechanism to control flow. When fully open, the gate is completely lifted out of the flow path.

### Best For
- Fully open or fully closed service
- Water supply lines
- Oil and gas pipelines
- Applications requiring low pressure drop

### Not Recommended For
- Throttling applications
- Rapid cycling
- High-velocity flow (may cause gate vibration)

### Our Products
- Forged Steel Gate Valve Class 800 (S/E, S/W)
- Cast Steel Gate Valve Class 150 (Flanged/Butt Weld)

## Globe Valves

### How They Work
Globe valves use a movable disc that seats against a stationary ring seat. The fluid path creates an S-shape, making them excellent for throttling.

### Best For
- Flow regulation/throttling
- Systems requiring frequent operation
- Steam and high-temperature applications
- Precise flow control

### Not Recommended For
- Applications requiring low pressure drop
- Large diameter installations
- Slurry or high-viscosity fluids

### Our Products
- Forged Steel Globe Valve Class 800 (S/E, S/W)
- Cast Steel Globe Valve Class 150 (Flanged/Butt Weld)

## Ball Valves

### How They Work
Ball valves use a spherical ball with a bore through the center. When the bore aligns with the flow, the valve is open; a 90° turn closes it.

### Best For
- Quick on/off operation (quarter-turn)
- Tight shutoff requirements
- Natural gas and oil applications
- Fire-safe applications (with proper design)
- Automated systems

### Not Recommended For
- Fine throttling (use V-port ball valves for better control)
- Extremely high temperatures (check seat material limits)

### Our Products
- One-piece, Two-piece, and Three-piece designs
- Flanged, Screwed, and Tri-clover connections
- Fire-safe API 607 certified options
- Pneumatic and electric actuated packages

## Butterfly Valves

### How They Work
A disc mounted on a rotating shaft controls flow. The disc rotates 90° between fully open and fully closed positions.

### Best For
- Large diameter applications
- Cost-sensitive installations
- HVAC systems
- Water treatment
- Low-pressure applications

### Not Recommended For
- High-pressure service
- Tight shutoff requirements
- Abrasive media (may damage disc)

### Our Products
- Wafer Type Butterfly Valve (PN10)
- Resilient Seat Centric Wafer Butterfly Valve

## Selection Guidelines

### 1. Define Your Application
- What fluid are you controlling?
- What are the pressure and temperature ranges?
- Is throttling required or just on/off?

### 2. Consider Operating Conditions
- How frequently will the valve operate?
- Is remote actuation needed?
- What is the available space for installation?

### 3. Calculate Pressure Drop
- For systems where pressure loss is critical, ball valves offer the lowest resistance
- Globe valves have the highest pressure drop

### 4. Evaluate Total Cost of Ownership
- Initial purchase price
- Installation costs
- Maintenance requirements
- Expected service life

## Making the Right Choice

| Application | Recommended Valve |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Pipeline isolation | Gate or Ball |
| Flow throttling | Globe |
| Quick shutoff | Ball |
| Large water lines | Butterfly |
| High-pressure service | Ball or Gate |
| Steam regulation | Globe |
| Process automation | Ball with actuator |

## Conclusion

There's no single "best" valve—the right choice depends on your specific application requirements. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each valve type helps you make an informed decision.
